This is a simple Java Program which interprets the Bare Bones language. This folder contains the Java code, as well as two example files of Bare Bones code. The sytem will
print the contents of all the variables in the system after each Bare Bones instruction has been processed. In order to use this interpreter, please download
BBInterpreter.java and place a Bare Bones text file (in similar style to the examples in this folder) within the same folder. Then navigate to this folder in your command
line, compile with 'javac BBInterpreter.java' and execute with 'java BBInterpreter <Bare-Bones-File>' where <Bare-Bones-File> is the name of the Bare Bones text file.
